Accounting Manual

# Accounting Manual



The Accounting Manual is a resource that provides information and guidance for accounting and financial management activities. The intended audience is Yale staff who have accounting and/or financial management responsibilities. Often, the documents here are related to the university’s Policy and Procedure documents and should be used along with these companion documents. For questions or additional accounting guidance, please contact the General Accounting team in the Controller’s Office at [controller.genacct@yale.edu](mailto:controller.genacct@yale.edu).

For additional support and guidance please note:

* General Accounting provides accounting guidance, but does not provide technical support for the Workday financial systems. That team is now known as Financial Systems and Solutions. Questions and requests for that team should be sent to [askfinance@yale.edu](mailto:askfinance@yale.edu).
* COA information, guidance and forms are found on the [COA website.](/work-yale/financial-management/accounting-controllers-office/chart-accounts-coa)
* Workday training and user guides are located on [Workday at Yale](https://workday.training.yale.edu/).
