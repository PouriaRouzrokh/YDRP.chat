Controller’s Office Factsheet

# Controller’s Office Factsheet



Revision Date:

April 1, 2025

The Controller’s Office Factsheet is a summary of frequently used financial and administrative information.

#### Mileage Allowance Rate

* **Business travel**: Effective 1/1/2025, 70 cents per mile.  
  + For expenses incurred 1/1/2024 to 12/31/2024, 67 cents per mile.
* **Moving**: Effective 1/1/2024, 21 cents per mile.  
  + For expenses incurred 7/1/2022 to 12/31/2023, 22 cents per mile.

#### Total Meals and Incidental Expenses Guideline

Out-of-pocket expenses (i.e. airfare, conference fees, mileage, hotel, meals, books, etc.) 120 days through 366 days from the date incurred will be reimbursed as taxable income to the employee.  Gross-up for taxes on this income is not allowed.  Expenses >366 days from the date incurred will not be reimbursed.  This means that the faculty and staff have a **maximum** of 119 days from the date the charge is incurred to the date the charge is included on an expense report and submitted for reimbursement through the expense management system.

* Anyone who incurs either PCard or out-of-pocket expenses has a financial responsibility to obtain and submit receipts greater than or equal to $75 or as requested by an Approver.  Receipts serve as critical documentation to substantiate the expenses and ensure compliance with policies and regulatory requirements.  Receipts are attached to the expense report at the header or line level. Preparers should check all scanned or uploaded attachments to be sure they are legible prior to submitting the report.  The expense management system requires a receipt if the line item expense is greater than or equal to $75.  It is a best practice, however, to submit all receipts – even those that are under $75.  All receipts should be retained until the associated expense report is fully approved plus ninety (90) days, at which point the originals should be shredded.  Approvers, at their discretion, have the right to require the submission of receipts for all expenses, including those under $75.  The Controller’s Office also has discretion to require the submission of receipts of any amount.  When a receipt is requested by an Approver or the Controller’s Office, expense report Requestors and Preparers are responsible for providing the requested receipt.

***-OR-***

* Federal published M&IE rates for U.S [domestic](http://www.gsa.gov/perdiem) and [foreign](https://aoprals.state.gov/Web920/per_diem.asp) travel when all 3 meals fall within the same travel day.  When travel covers only part of a day, or if the cost of one or more meals is covered by another source, the per diem rate is prorated accordingly.  Incidental expenses included in the per diem rate: laundry, dry cleaning, tips for services.  When the per diem rate is used, such expenses are not reimbursed separately.

When a department’s workload necessitates **overtime work** of 2 hours or more after normal University hours, the department may pay the employees a meal allowance of $12 or reimburse actual meal costs up to $12.

#### Petty Cash

Treasury Services and petty cash will no longer process out-of- pocket reimbursements for faculty and staff (submit via the expense management system instead).  Treasury Services and petty cash will reimburse out-of-pocket expenses for students and visitors *only for amounts of $300 or less.*They will also issue cash advances to faculty, staff, and students.

#### Purchasing Authorization Limits/Threshold

University employees who participate in purchasing transactions must be free from real or apparent purchasing conflicts of interest.  Prior to completing any purchasing transaction, please review the [General Purchasing Policy](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/3201-general-purchasing) for specific restrictions and disclosure requirements.

Dollar limits for purchasing transactions are as follows:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Purchasing Card** | Small dollar business purchases <$2,000, not available through SciQuest, Non-travel limit: $2,000 per transaction; $10,000 per month. |
| **Out-of-Pocket** | In limited circumstances, small purchases may be made using personal funds.  Reimbursement for purchases of this type should be done via EMS.  However, if a personal credit card or cash is used for travel and small expenses, the University **will** reimburse for sales tax paid. |
| **Bids or Single/Sole Source** | Over $10,000 written. |
| **Treasury Services and Petty Cash** | Out-of-pocket reimbursements for faculty and staff are not allowed from petty cash, such reimbursements should be made via EMS.  Petty cash is only available for out-of-pocket expenses for students and visitors and to issue cash advances to faculty, staff, and students. |
| **Deposits, Down Payments, and Prepayments** | All deposits, down payments, and prepayments equal to or greater than $25,000 must be approved by the Director of Purchasing Services. |

#### 

## Sales Tax Exemption

### Meals and Lodging

Certain lodging and meal expenses incurred while traveling on University business may be exempt from state sales tax provided the:

* State allows an exemption for meals and/or lodging expenses,
* University holds a state sales tax exemption certificate in the state of travel, where required, and
* University makes payments directly to the hotel or restaurant using a Yale Purchasing Card or check.

Currently, the University qualifies for travel related sales tax exemption in the states listed here: [Sales and Use Tax](https://your.yale.edu/work-yale/financial-management/tax-compliance-planning/sales-and-use-tax).  The University is reviewing the sales tax exemption requirements in additional states and will update the chart as additional exemptions are obtained.

To obtain a Connecticut sales tax exemption for purchases of meals or lodging, refer to the University [Sales and Use Tax page](https://your.yale.edu/work-yale/financial-management/tax-compliance-planning/sales-and-use-tax).

If you plan to incur meals and/or lodging expenses in one of the sales tax exempt states, please contact the University Tax department prior to travel.  The Tax department will provide you with any relevant exemption forms with respect to meals and/or lodging expenses, depending on the state.

**Note:** In order to obtain exemption, the University must make the payment directly to the hotel or restaurant using a Yale Purchasing Card or check.  The sales tax exemption will not apply if a traveler makes the payment using a personal credit card.

**Purchase of Other Services or Property**

To obtain a Connecticut sales tax exemption certificate, Form CERT-119, for a purchase other than meals and lodging, contact the Tax Department (203-432-5530).  In limited circumstances, the University may purchase items for resale. Contact the Tax department for a resale certificate.  CERT-119 should not be used for purchases that are made for resale.

For sales tax exemptions with respect to purchases of property or services (other than meals or lodging) outside the State of Connecticut, contact the University Tax department (203-432-5530).
