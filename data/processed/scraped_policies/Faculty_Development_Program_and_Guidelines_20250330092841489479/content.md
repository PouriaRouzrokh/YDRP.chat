https://medicine.yale.edu/oapd/academicaffairs/processesdocuments/timeline/

## A. Preliminary Consideration by the YDR Promotions Advisory Committee (PAC)

The YDR Promotions Advisory Committee meets every June to August to review the list of junior faculty and make recommendations for reappointment or promotion. The impacted faculty members are contacted by the department's faculty affairs team with instructions and deadlines relative to the materials that they will need to assemble. Any promotion to the Associate Professor with Tenure or Professor ranks require submission by the Chair of a Request for Tenure or Continuing Position form to the Yale School of Medicine Office of Academic and Professional Development (OAPD) office.

---

# B. Consideration by YDR Senior Faculty 

The process of promotion requires independent assessments of a faculty member's candidacy by referees, academic faculty outside of YDR. For ladder track faculty promotions, prior to soliciting referee letters, YDR Senior Faculty (ie, YDR Appointments \& Promotion Committee) meet to discuss promotions as recommended by the PAC. The assembled faculty vote by closed ballot on whether or not to move forward with each promotion by soliciting referee letters.

YDR Senior Faculty consist of those at the rank of Associate Professor with Tenure and full Professor and the committee is chaired by the Vice Chair, Doug Rothman, PhD and Director of Faculty Affairs Richard Bronen, M.D. As part of the departmental policy, Senior Faculty may invite the following junior faculty for appointment and promotion meetings as indicated below:

| A\&P Procedure | Voting Faculty (ie, YDR A\&P Comm)*** |
| :--: | :--: |
| (1) Appointment of Instructor or Assistant Professor (any track); <br> Reappointment of Assistant or Associate Professor; all Clinical track reappointments including at end of $2^{\text {nd }}$ term [for other tracks, see process for $2^{\text {nd }}$ term reappointments below] | Chair decision* |
| (2) Promotion: Assistant to Associate Professor <br> $2^{\text {nd }}$ Term Reappointment of Assistant Professor [except Clinical track - see (1)] | All Associate and Full Professors |
| (3) Promotion: Associate Professor to Associate Professor with Tenure; <br> $2^{\text {nd }}$ Term Reappointment or Initial Appointment of Associate Professor [except Clinical track - see (1)] | All Associate with Tenure and Full Professors |
| (4) Promotion: Associate Professor to Full Professor | Full Professors |
| Reappointments not listed above do not require A\&P committee votes |  |
| Secondary appointments/promotion | Chair decision, in consultation with Section Chief |
| Joint appointment | Similar to YDR appointment |
| Promotion to Research Scientist** | Associate and Full Professors, Research and Senior Research Scientist |
| Promotion to Senior Research Scientist** | Senior Research Scientists, Full Professors |

---

*with advisement by the Promotions Advisory Committee regarding candidates suitability or progress
**YDR A\&P Committee votes after letters obtained. Decision to proceed to request letters is based on Bioimaging Science Group leader recommendation, with approval vote by Promotions Advisory Committee.
***For initial appointments at Associate and full Professor levels, YDR A\&P Committee votes after letters obtained. Decision to proceed to request letters is based on Chair decision after consultation with Promotions Advisory Committee.

# C. Collection of materials for Appointments and Promotions for Ladder Faculty with Term Appointments 

The table below outlines the materials that are needed for appointments, reappointments and promotions for each track and rank. For more information about each requirement, click on the link in the header.

| Appointment or Promotion to (rank) | Trac k | Yale CV 1 | Yale CV 2 | Samples of Scholarship (Reprints) (Up to 5) | Teaching Evaluations | Letters of Evaluation (Deferee letters needed)** | Dept Vote |

*Arms-length: People you have NOT worked or collaborated directly with in the past. However, collaborators on "Guidelines" or "Standards" publication CAN be used as arms-length referees
**Candidates provide half of the referee names, while senior dept faculty provide the remaining names of referees to the Dept. The Chair or Dean then sends out the requests for letters of reference to the Referees, who review the materials (CV, CV2, and articles). Teaching evaluations are not sent to referees, but reviewed by YDR A\&P Com.

# D. Formal Review by the Department Faculty 

After the letters of recommendation have been received, the eligible voting faculty review them before formal discussion of the candidate at a scheduled meeting. These letters are confidential and should not be discussed except at the scheduled meeting of the senior faculty (ie, YDR A\&P Com).

During these A\&P meetings, the eligible faculty vote by closed ballot to approve or disapprove the appointment/reappointment/promotion. It is very important to note that discussions at department meetings concerned with appointments and promotions constitute privileged information that must be kept in strict confidence.

For virtual (zoom) A\&P vote meetings, a faculty member must use both audio and visual technology that enables the faculty member to see and hear, and be seen and heard by all other faculty members participating in the vote. A faculty member deemed present by such technological means may submit a ballot in a manner that keeps it confidential (and cannot attend while in a public venue). The preferred confidential vote method is Poll Everywhere.

YSM recommended minimum quorums for departmental voting are based on the smaller of the following:

- $\mathrm{N}=15$ eligible voters for the rank being voted on
- $50 \%$ of eligible voters for departments where this is less than the above stated number (but cannot be less than $\mathrm{N}=4$ )


## E. Submission to the Office of Academic and Professional Development

After the appointment/reappointment/promotion approval at the department level, all materials are forwarded to the Office of Academic and Professional Development at Yale School of Medicine. For promotions, the Chair, or their delegate, presents the candidate to the YSM A\&P Committee. Upon approval, the appointment/promotion is presented to the Board of Permanent Officers and then forwarded to the Provost for consideration and presentation to the Yale Corporation. The Yale Corporation has sole authority to grant appointments, reappointments, and promotions. The process can take many months, as there are many schedules to coordinate, and appointments to consider. Faculty appointments/promotions are not formally recorded in Yale systems or directories until BPO approval.

# SECTION 3: CLINICAL RADIOLOGY DIVISION 

http://radiology.yale.edu/facintranet/development/

## A. Guidelines of Requirements for Reappointment \& Promotion in C, CE \& CS Tracks

The School of Medicine offers 3 ladder tracks for clinical physicians/radiologists as avenues for advancement. The Clinical Track, was instituted in July 2018 and is focused on clinical excellence, education without the need for scholarship. In the Clinician Educator Track, promotion is based on both clinical excellence and education, supported by efforts in scholarship; expectation is 20\% FTE education and scholarship.

The 3rd ladder track for clinical faculty is the Clinician-Scientist Track, whereby promotion is based on both clinical excellence and research efforts, with the expectation of research grants, clinical trials, and original research publications; the expectation is $\geq 50 \%$ FTE research funding. While the expectations of C, CE and CS differ, the process is similar. Appointments and promotion within the Yale Faculty teaching tracks are governed by policies stated in the Yale University Faculty Handbook, and specifically within the School of Medicine section.

Requirements for appointments, reappointments and promotions include:
a) Excellence as clinicians (C, CS, CE)
b) Excellence as teachers (C, CS, CE)
c) Participation in research endeavors (CS, CE)
d) Professionalism (all tracks) - compliance with Yale University Standard of Conduct and Yale New Haven Health Standards of Professional Behavior

## B. Request for Transfer of Tracks

At the assistant professor rank, transfer of track typically occurs at the end of the term. Requests to transfer track at the rank of associate professor on term should be submitted two years prior to the end of the appointment. If approved, the transfer may occur any time within the two-year period before the appointment's end date.

| Transfer to: | Comment |
| :-- | :-- |
| Assistant Professor, any track | Transfer of track typically occurs at the end of the term |
| Associate Professor | Requests to transfer track at the rank of associate professor <br> on term should be submitted two years prior to the end of <br> the appointment. If approved, the transfer may occur any <br> time within the two-year period before the appointment's <br> end date. |
| Associate Professor, Clinical Track | Transfers from the rank of associate professor in any track to <br> the Clinical Track are not subject to this time limitation <br> provided that the faculty member has achieved excellence as <br> a practitioner in their field and meets the requirements of <br> the associate professor rank in the Clinical Track |
| Associate Professor, Traditional Track | Permitted only for faculty who have served at the ranks of <br> assistant professor and associate professor for a total of <br> fewer than eight years. Such requests must be reviewed and <br> approved by the appropriate appointments and promotions <br> committee |
| Associate Professors CE/CS Tracks | Permitted on rare occasions and only with approval from the <br> Dean and Provost |

Transfers should always be effective as of July $1^{\text {st }}$.

---

# C. CLINICAL TRACK 

- Advances School's clinical mission
- Teaching should be undertaken
- No scholarly output required or expected
- No limit on the number of terms at any rank, provided there is a continued need and financial support and demonstration of clinical excellence and productivity
- Considerations for a transfer from the Clinical Track to any other track requires documentation of scholarship potential, a mentoring plan, location of activities and a CV/CV2
- Promotion predicated:
- On clinical skills and excellence
- Playing an integral role in clinical programs and programmatic development
- $>90 \%$ clinical time (including administrative time)
- Reappointment contingent on continued faculty excellence, productivity, financial support and programmatic need. If any of these are found unsatisfactory, as determined by the department and the Office of the Dean, non-reappointment requires 1 years written notice for terms of appointment greater than one year. One-year appointments require 60 days' written notice.


## Clinical Track

and delivery of clinical care more broadly are encouraged. Faculty must be highly-respected "citizens" of their Department and the School, as demonstrated by 1) participation and/or leadership on committees of YSM, Yale Medicine, and/or practice sites associated with YSM; 2) collaboration with other Yale faculty on research or other scholarly activities; and/or 3) other professional service that enhances the academic community of YSM. All faculty should be viewed as excellent teachers and as models of clinical excellence. Faculty are encouraged but not required to participate in research and scholarly activities, most often within the context of their clinical practice. Appointments are made for terms of up to five years. There is no limit to the number of terms a faculty member may serve at this rank, but there is no entitlement to reappointment."

# EVALUATION OF ACADEMIC CLINICAL EXCELLENCE [CLINICAL TRACK] 

| Promotion to Associate Professor <br> - Candidates for promotion to associate professor will have demonstrated excellence in clinical care with a local and regional reputation for delivering excellent quality care and outstanding professionalism.

---

Reappointment contingent on continued faculty excellence, productivity, financial support and programmatic need.

Letters: 10 requested (LOR for other tracks are free-form; however, the Clinical Track referee evaluation is a template, see Addendum 2), minimum of 4 letters from individuals not affiliated with Yale and 2 internal Yale letters (but not from YDR faculty) that attest to the applicant's excellent accomplishments and reputation as a clinician. Outside letters can include former mentees and referring physicians.

# Professor of Clinical Radiology - term up to 5 years (renewable) 

- Promotion based on national reputation for clinical activities

Candidates should be "distinguished clinicians and educators, who demonstrate eminence in their field with established and sustained excellence in their area of practice. They should be master clinicians who are broadly recognized for their superior abilities and contributions to the Yale Medicine practice and their specialty. They should exhibit the highest qualities of humanism and passion for clinical medicine, clinical acumen, professionalism, communication and interpersonal skills. Most often candidates for professor will have national recognition of their eminence, as for example by holding leadership positions within national societies. In exceptional instances, the candidate's reputation locally among Yale Medicine physicians, the Yale New Haven Health System, and other YSM-associated practice sites and their contributions to advancing the clinical mission of the School may be of such an outstanding caliber and consistency to be sufficient for promotion to the professor rank. Candidates should be highly sought out as teachers and clinical mentors for students, residents, and/or fellows in their area of expertise. They must be highly-respected "citizens" of their Department and the School, and have evidence of an ongoing commitment to advancing the missions of the School and their field of expertise. It is anticipated that such candidates will have received awards for clinical and/or educational excellence, and be viewed as the most exceptional and outstanding clinical faculty in the department and School.

# D. CLINICIAN EDUCATOR TRACK 

Initial appointment - at Instructor on an annual basis or Assistant Professor
Assistant Professor - Appointments for terms up to 3 years; "total time in this rank generally does not exceed 9 years. There is no entitlement to reappointment." Yale Faculty Handbook

Associate Professor - Promotion AND reappointment predicated on the expectation that one will "influence the teaching or practice of medicine in a significant way including through scholarship." Appointments for terms up to 5 years; once promoted to Associate Professor, it is expected there will be continued scholarship for reappointment. Departmental guidelines for promotion to Associate Professorin this track:
a) Recognized regionally as an expert for clinical skillsets and teaching abilities, with "an emerging regional reputation for outstanding scholarship."
b) Via invited speakerships, conference presentations, and/or involvement in society organizations
c) Publications - in general, 1-2/year or at least a dozen peer reviewed publications with first or last authorship in half of these, excluding abstract publications, case reports, technical notes or reports. Education publications include review articles and chapters. The A\&P (Appointments \& Promotion) committee is looking for substantial involvement in most of these publications; as assessed by primary authorship (i.e., first author, which should be the focus early in the career) or mentorship of the publication (i.e., last author). Please note: an emerging national reputation can be achieved using media other than traditional print scholarship, if emerging national reputation can be substantiated through other means (e.g., involvement in Practice Guidelines and Standards, prominent invited speaking engagements, etc.)
d) Years at rank - it is rare to be promoted to Associate Professor prior to 2 terms (at least 6 years) at the level of Assistant Professor.
e) Letters from referees that support the promotion

Professor - Promotion is predicated on the expectation that candidates "must be national or international leaders in their fields, with scholarship that has had a national impact on clinical medicine,public health, or education, as well as by sustained excellence in patient care and teaching." Appointments on a continuing basis. Promotion guidelines include:
a) National reputation for outstanding scholarship
b) Publications - The A\&P committee is looking for substantial involvement in most of these publications; as assessed by primary authorship (i.e., first author) earlier in one's career and mentorship of the publication (i.e., last author) later in one's career. The impact of one's scholarship on the field is most important; i.e., quality of publications and status of journals is more important than number of publications. In general, the average number of publications is 60 for those promoted at YSM in this track, though there is no publication threshold for promotion. Candidates for promotion to Professor, in general, should have at least 40 peer-reviewed publications, with at least half as first or last/senior authors, excluding abstract publications, case reports, letters or technical notes, but again, there is no publication threshold. Please note:

---

national reputation can be achieved using media other than traditional print scholarship, if emerging national reputation can be substantiated through other means (e.g., involvement in Practice Guidelines and Standards, prominent invited speaking engagements, etc.)
c) Years at rank - it is rare to be promoted to Professor prior to at least 6 years ( 2 terms) at Assistant and at least 8-10 years (close to 2 terms) at Associate Professor ranks.
d) Letters from referees that support the promotion

## Section 4: FEEDBACK TO FACULTY A\&P PROGRESS:

## A. Annual Survey for Faculty Career Development

(1) Annual Review:
(a). Each ladder faculty member in the Clinical Radiology Division is required to complete a form annually, known as the faculty career development survey to track activities that have occurred over the previous 12-month period and to review goals for the upcoming year. They will have an annual meeting with leadership to review survey details and accomplishments over the past year.

## (2) Leadership Assessment

Periodically, the Chair's or Dean's office will conduct anonymous surveys of leadership positions in the department, asking faculty members to assess leaders in the department including the Chair, Vice Chairs, Section Chiefs, and Program Directors. The Chair or Dean will provide feedback and constructive criticism those leaders.
B. Mentor feedback - see \#3. below

## C. Promotions Advisory Committee Review

Each June - August, YDR's Promotion Advisory Committee (formerly known as the "Internal A\&P committee", currently composed of Professors Bronen, M Johnson, Peters, Goodman, Rothman, and Weinreb) meet to discuss all Assistant Professors and all Associate Professors to review

---

progress towards reappointment or promotion. One member (often the Chair, Committee Chair or Director for Faculty Affairs) is assigned to provide feedback and suggestions from committee to faculty members as needed.

# SECTION 5: YDR MENTORING PROGRAMS 

## A. Orientation \& Dissemination of information via Intranet

Within 1-2 months of appointment in YDR, the Chair or his/her designates, and/or Director for Academic Affairs and/or YDR or YSM Faculty Affairs office will provide new faculty members with an orientation to the A\&P process, including this document. The Medical School provides an orientation during the summer/early Fall. Faculty members are alerted to the Clinical Faculty Intranet site, which houses information and resources.

## B. Faculty Promotion Advisor for junior faculty

Junior faculty in the Clinical Radiology Division can choose (or else will be assigned to) a Faculty Promotion Advisor, a senior leader in the department who is familiar with the promotion process. Current Faculty Promotion Advisors are:

- Rick Bronen, Director Faculty Affairs
- Howie Forman, Director Financial Affairs
- Rob Fulbright, Medical Director of MR Research Center
- Michele Johnson, Director Interventional Neuroradiology
- Ajay Malhotra, Director of Neuroradiology Research

Each Promotion Advisor will review progress toward promotions on an annual basis and provide the junior faculty member with a very brief written summary of their discussion/feedback; this summary will be sent to the Chair and will be included in the faculty member's appointment and promotion (A\&P) file. Faculty may request that the Promotion Advisor be different fromtheir section-designated mentor to provide a broader perspective on the A\&P process. Promotion Advisors may offer all of the following:

- --assistance in establishing short and long-term career goals
- --advice on time management
- --information regarding department/school expectations regarding reappointments and promotions
- --guidance on issues of scholarship, teaching, administration, supervision of others, and collaboration with colleagues.
- --while it is beyond the scope of a faculty promotion advisory, in certain cases, they may provide assistance in helping individuals network within the institution and nationally or provide an understanding of pathways for doing so

---

# C. Academic or Section Chief Mentors 

In addition to the Promotion Advisor, it is important for junior faculty members to have an Academic Mentor to help guide them in their career. Since a strong rapport is paramount in a mentor-mentee relationship, the junior faculty member may choose their Academic Mentor. Otherwise, the Section Chief or (senior)faculty member designated by the Section Chief will mentor junior faculty members in their focused fields. The Academic/Section Mentor will meet with the mentee on at least an annual or semiannual basis (with suggestion to mentor new faculty more frequently) to review goals and progress, and discuss:

- --assistance in establishing short and long-term career goals
- --advice on time management
- --information regarding department/school expectations
- --guidance on issues of scholarship, teaching, administration, supervision of others, and collaboration with colleagues.
- --some mentors may also act as sponsors, providing assistance in helping with networking within the institution \& nationally, lectureships, or administrative responsibilities

In some cases, the Section Chief/designate mentor may also be the Faculty Promotion Advisor. The Section Chief will provide feedback to the Chair regarding the faculty member's progress via Individual Productivity Form review each May. A formal meeting reviewing goals and progress (with a written summary of the goals for the academic year to be sent to the Chair, via his/her administrative assistant) should occur annually, often between May and October.

## D. Programs for Faculty Development

The department provides support for faculty development in a multitude of ways:

1. Staff Fund. Faculty are provided with a staff fund for conference or resource support.
2. Courses. YDR supports nominating and sending junior faculty to faculty development courses; YDR will fund travel and conference fees. (Note: there are other faculty development courses or programs available that may be suitable to individual faculty). Selection is competitive and is determined by initial application to YDR Faculty Developmental Committee. These courses \& programs, descriptions, along with application dates will be listed on the Radiologist Portal, of the YDR webpage. Selection is based on

- Appropriateness for career development,
- Strength of the application,
- CV/ Academic productivity,
- Professionalism,
- Years at rank of Assistant Professor
- Evaluations, by trainees and faculty - where appropriate.

3. Support for education or research endeavors - see YDR Research webpage

- Statistics support (including support by Larry Staib, PhD in our BIS Division)
- Photographic and graphic design support

# SECTION 6: BIOIMAGING SCIENCES DIVISION 

Mentoring within the Bioimaging Sciences Division is performed primarily by the lead senior faculty members within the four primary imaging groups.

These mentors are all physically located adjacent to their mentees and informal advice is given on a weekly, if not daily, basis.

In addition, the group leaders listed above have other senior faculty with extensive mentoring experience. As described above, for all assistant and term associate faculty members in BIS are required to choose an official mentor from the BIS senior faculty. At least one meeting per year with the official faculty mentor is required, and more are encouraged. Also choosing additional formal and informal mentors from the department and outside the department is encouraged.

Formal reviews are performed annually when all junior faculty are required to complete a BIS Faculty Activity Form describing their accomplishments in terms of publications, grants, teaching, outreach and service. The Department Chair and Vice-Chair for BIS appointments and promotions will review these with each mentee and providefeedback and suggestions regarding progress towards academic excellence and possible promotion.

The senior mentors noted above are also given feedback regarding the progress of their mentees.
With the lifting of COVID restrictions, BIS Faculty Members will again host regular lunches with the junior faculty, in order to provide informal adviceon promotion and career development.

# ADDENDUM 4: LETTERS OF EVALUATION from ARMS VS NON-ARMS LENGTH REFEREES 

## https://medicine.yale.edu/oapd/academicaffairs/processesdocuments/letters/

Letters of evaluation (also referred to as "referee letters") are a valued component of the review process for the appointment and promotions of faculty. They are used to assess how peers and experts view an individual's accomplishments, expertise, and impact on a field. The department or dean's Office, depending upon the rank, solicits letters of evaluation for faculty positions, which must be written by colleagues who hold positions equivalent to or higher than the rank proposed for the appointment/promotion.

## There are two types of letters of evaluation:

Arm's-length letters are from external referees who are known scholars or experts in the field and who are able to provide an objective, impartial evaluation of the candidate's accomplishments.

Arm's-length referees may include:

- Those who know of a faculty candidate's reputation in the field, but have not worked with them directly.
- Co-authors or co-investigators of large, multi-center clinical trials or consortiums where there has not been direct engagement.

Arm's-length letters should not come from referees who:

- Are unable to provide an impartial review of the faculty candidate for any reason.
- Have been a supervisor, mentor or peer of the candidate during their training.
- Have collaborated, published or shared funding with the candidate, except as noted above. Seek advice from the DAPD if the department is uncertain whether a potential referee can be considered arm's length.

Non-arm's-length letters are from referees who have direct knowledge of the candidate's professional (clinical, educational, administrative and/or scholarly) activities, as for example through their service as a mentor, collaborator, or intramural colleague. These should NOT come from faculty in the SAME DEPARTMENT as the faculty candidate.

## General guidance for letters of evaluation

Specifics about the number and type of referees to be suggested by the department and the faculty candidate are indicated in the table below. Please note that letters are solicited by the department chair or the dean, depending on the rank, and the faculty candidate should NOT reach out directly to those from whom letters will be solicited.

The referee List Template will be completed by the department. Templates for soliciting letters are available from the OAPD, and all will be asked to complete the external Referee Form.
