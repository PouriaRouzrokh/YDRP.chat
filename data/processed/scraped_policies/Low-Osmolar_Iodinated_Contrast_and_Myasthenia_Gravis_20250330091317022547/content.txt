INFORMATION FOR
# Low-Osmolar Iodinated Contrast and Myasthenia Gravis
Low-osmolar iodinated contrast has been shown to have a weak association with exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis-related symptoms, most commonly respiratory compromise. This association has been discussed with Yale Neurology who feel that the low risk does not merit screening patients for Myasthenia at this point. If a patient declares himself or herself as suffering from Myasthenia Gravis, our policy should be to reassure them that it is highly unlikely that any deterioration in symptoms will occur.
