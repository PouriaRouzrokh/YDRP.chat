## **Observerships for Physicians**
Our policy is not to encourage post-graduate observerships for those outside the Yale New Haven Health System, because these divert time away from our primary education mission to teach Yale students and Yale & YNHH trainees, and we would be inundated with such requests. There is no formal observership course or process. However, there are two pathways for such observerships; each of which relies on a *sponsoring YDR faculty member* to provide primary oversight:
**1. Visiting Scholar:** The observing physician attends as a visiting scholar sponsored by a faculty member. The *sponsoring faculty* member must oversee all aspects of the visit for the visiting scholar, and the visit should be focused in *sponsoring faculty’s* area of specialty. If the visiting scholar is going to observe with others, then the *sponsoring faculty* member must make obtain approval from the section chief, rest of the section and integrate the visit based on scheduling issues (ie, number of residents and students that month) and that the section agrees to host as well. For the scholar to observe in other sections, you must get approval from other section chiefs (and their sections). Emily Foote needs to be notified at the onset of this process, to ensure requirements are followed and to provide access to facilities and a Yale ID.
**2. Observership in a section:** The section can offer observerships for a fee - the fee is similar to the fees that we charge outside residents and goes to your section fund (For FY2014, rates are $5510 for 4 weeks and $2755 for 2 weeks or less). The section agrees to teach individuals and the individual agrees to pay for the teaching. Both the section chief and section have to agree to this and put together a curriculum or agenda for the observer; A YDR faculty member or section chief must take responsibility for overseeing the observership visit and curriculum. There must be a capacity for the section members to provide adequate teaching for residents, fellows in addition to the observer and ensure that trainee teaching is not compromised; scheduling of the observer must be timed appropriately into the YDR resident schedule.
