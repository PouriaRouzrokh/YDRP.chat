# Sabbatical & Triennial Leaves of Absence

**Deadline:** The deadline for submitting a request for Sabbatical or Triennial Leave of Absence beginning on or after July 1, for any academic year, is **January 16** of the previous academic year. ( e.g., requests for leaves effective during the 2015-2016 academic year must be received by January 16, 2015 ). This is an absolute deadline. There can be NO EXCEPTIONS made to this policy.
