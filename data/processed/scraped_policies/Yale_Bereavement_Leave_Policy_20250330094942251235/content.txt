Bereavement
# Bereavement
Regular employees scheduled to work at least 20 hours each week are entitled to up to three days off without loss of pay in the event of death in the immediate family. Immediate family is defined as parent, parent-in-law, brother, sister, spouse, child, grandparent, domestic partner, grandchild, or person in an equivalent relationship. Exceptions to this policy require approval by the Assistant Vice President for Employee Relations and Staffing. If additional time is necessary, departments may allow the employee to use PTO days or may approve a personal leave.
