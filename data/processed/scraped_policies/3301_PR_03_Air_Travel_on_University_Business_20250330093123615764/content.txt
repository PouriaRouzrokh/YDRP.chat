# 3301 PR.03 Air Travel on University Business
Revision Date:
March 29, 2023
## Contents
## 1. Overview
This procedure supports [Policy 3301](/policies-procedures/policies/3301-travel-university-business) *Travel on University Business*, specifically the air travel rules and requirements established in [Section 3301.2](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/3301-travel-university-business#3301.2).  It details the processes and guidelines relating to air travel on University business.
## 2. Fundamentals of Air Travel Reservations
Travelers (or their designees) conducting Yale business are encouraged to plan their travel as far in advance as possible, as the availability of lower air fares is generally greater when reservations are booked well in advance.  While the optimal booking time may vary by airline and destination, the effective practice is to book travel as far in advance as possible when plans become firm.  ***Note*:** travel on sponsored awards may be governed by different requirements.  In such instances, travelers and their designees are expected to comply with the sponsor’s (federal or non-federal) terms and conditions.
Travelers (or their designees) are expected to select air travel within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements.  The University acknowledges that commercial airlines vary in their ticketing structures and do not necessarily offer consistent services in single fares.  Therefore, Yale considers “air travel within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements” to mean airfare within the basic cabin class (i.e., equivalent of “economy” or “coach,” regardless of the specific airline’s name for this class) that is consistent with business requirements.
Travelers (or their designees) may make incremental purchases and upgrades (e.g., preferred seating, checked luggage, etc.) within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class, as follows, to the extent such items/services are not included in the airfare price:
Travelers may also purchase meals and alcoholic drinks (alcohol is ***not*** allowable on federally sponsored awards) if they are not included in the airfare price, but travelers (or their designees) are expected to include such purchases as one of their allowable travel meals (see [Procedure 3301 PR.01](/policies-procedures/procedures/3301-pr01-travel-arrangements-university-business) *Travel Arrangements for University Business*).
Lead Administrators (and their designees) retain the discretion to impose tighter pricing expectations for budgetary and other considerations, as well as the discretion to evaluate whether selected air travel is consistent with business requirements.
**A. Preferred Travel Supplier and Online Booking Tool**
Travelers (or their designees) are not required, but they are encouraged, to book air travel using the University’s preferred travel supplier, [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2).  It provides a number of services and allows travelers to take advantage of University-negotiated discounts.
**B. Charter and/or Private Aircraft**
For the safety of travelers, the University does not recommend flying on charter and/or private aircraft.  The University assumes no liability for death, personal injury, or property damage in connection with charter/private aircraft travel.
If a traveler finds it necessary to travel by private aircraft due to unusual circumstances, exceptions for such circumstances require prior approval, consistent with the Exceptions and Special Circumstances section of [Policy 3301](/policies-procedures/policies/3301-travel-university-business) *Travel on University Business*.  If the exception is granted, the traveler (or their designee) must notify the [Office of Enterprise Risk Management](https://ogc.yale.edu/erm/office-enterprise-risk-management) before the flight occurs for insurance purposes.  When a private plane or charter aircraft is used primarily for the convenience of the traveler, reimbursement/payment will not exceed airfare within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements, for a comparable trip.
**C. Airline Club Memberships**
The University does not pay dues or fees for a traveler’s membership in airline clubs.
**D. Changes and Cancellations**
Travelers and their designees should endeavor to avoid change and cancellation fees whenever possible.  In the event a traveler incurs a change or cancellation penalty:
**E. Required Documentation**
Travelers (or their designees) are expected to provide documentation via an expense report for all air travel on University business (see [Procedure 3215 PR.02](/policies-procedures/procedures/3215-pr02-yale-expense-management-pcard-and-out-pocket-expenses) *Yale Expense Management (PCard and Out-of-Pocket Expenses)* for details on expense reports).  This documentation includes the following, at a minimum:
## 3. Non-Economy Class Air Travel
Travelers on University business are ***not*** permitted to use first class for air travel.  Travelers may, however, use business class for air travel if the relevant business office confirms before purchase that appropriate funds are available and if any of the following conditions are met:
Students must travel economy or economy-equivalent class regardless of duration or length of the flight.  Business class is permitted for students, however, for medical justifications documented in writing by a primary care provider.
In rare cases, other extenuating circumstances may justify the use of business class for trips that do not meet the above conditions.  Exceptions for such circumstances require prior approval, consistent with the Exceptions and Special Circumstances section of [Policy 3301](/policies-procedures/policies/3301-travel-university-business) *Travel on University Business*.
***Note***: For travel expenses that are administered by Yale but will be reimbursed in full by a third party, business class travel is allowable if approved and documented by the sponsoring institution/entity and documented in the expense report.
**A. Documentation of Approved Business Class Air Travel**
If a traveler is allowed to fly business class, the traveler (or their designee) must determine and document the cost of business class that exceeds airfare within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements, for a comparable trip.  The traveler (or their designee) is also responsible for charging that excess cost differential using appropriate charging instructions (see [Accounting for Air Travel Expenses](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/other/accounting-air-travel-expenses)), consistent with the following:
The traveler (or their designee) is responsible for documenting the cost of business class that exceeds airfare within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements, for a comparable trip for all University travel, regardless of the charging instructions used.  To do so, the traveler (or their designee) is expected to attach documentation to the applicable expense report showing an airfare comparison from a travel service (e.g., [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2), Sanditz, Travelocity, Orbitz, Expedia) contemporaneous with the business class booking.
## 4. Frequent Flier Programs, Personal Upgrades, and Personal Travel
**A. Frequent Flyer Programs**
The University allows travelers to accrue their own frequent flyer mileage for trips taken on University business.  The University does not, however, reimburse travelers for tickets or upgrades purchased with frequent flyer miles or other reward points.
**B. Personal Upgrades**
Travelers may upgrade the level of air service at personal expense or by using their frequent flyer miles or other reward points.  In opting to do so, travelers (or their designees) must document the source of the upgrade on the applicable expense report and must personally cover the excess cost differential between the purchased ticket and the trip’s comparable airfare within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements.  To do so, the traveler (or their designee) is expected to attach documentation to the applicable expense report showing an airfare comparison from a travel service (e.g., [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2), Sanditz, Travelocity, Orbitz, Expedia) contemporaneous with the booking.
**C. Personal Travel Combined with Business Travel**
Whenever possible, personal expenses should be charged separately when making travel arrangements.  If part of the business trip is personal/leisure and requires extra bags (e.g., golf clubs), the cost of the extra bags is personal.
If a travel itinerary is structured to accommodate personal business or leisure, the traveler must pay the incremental cost of personal travel and document the costs incurred, separating personal expenses from University business expenses.  To do so, the traveler (or their designee) is expected to attach documentation to the applicable expense report showing an airfare comparison from a travel service (e.g., [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2), Sanditz, Travelocity, Orbitz, Expedia) contemporaneous with the booking.  The cost of the University business component needs to be clearly differentiated from the cost of the personal component, as demonstrated by the examples below:
## 5. Air Travel on Sponsored Awards: General Principles
Travel charged to sponsored awards is subject to specific limitations and restrictions set by the sponsor(s) and, if applicable, federal regulations.  Travel restrictions may vary between federal and non-federal sponsors.  Additional restrictions not specifically covered by this policy, but sponsor specific, may apply.  Address questions to your award manager in the Office of Sponsored Projects (“[OSP](https://your.yale.edu/research-support/office-sponsored-projects/osp-contacts)”).
Certain expenditures (e.g., alcohol) are “unallowable” in accordance with federal cost principles and cannot be charged to a federal award or non-federal award, depending on the terms and conditions of the award.  Some expenses not allowed on a sponsored award may, however, be reimbursed by non-sponsored funds under specific circumstances if the expense is reasonable, adheres to University policy, is broken out separately from the allowable expense(s), and is coded to the proper account number listed in the University’s Chart of Accounts.  For additional information and proper use of ledger accounts and spend categories, refer to [Procedure 1305 PR.04](/policies-procedures/procedures/1305-pr04-unallowable-costs) *Unallowable Costs*.
**A. Changes and Cancellations**
Changes and cancellations, in general, are covered in [Section 2](#2), above.  In addition to that guidance, the following applies to air travel on sponsored awards:
**B. Air Travel on a Federally Sponsored Award: Airfare Pricing Principles and Documentation**
Travelers (or their designees) on federally sponsored awards and subawards are expected to select air travel within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements (defined in [Section 2](#2), above).
Travelers (or their designees) on federally sponsored awards and subawards are expected to document their selection of air travel within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements.  To accomplish this, the University strongly recommends the use of Yale’s preferred travel service for travel on federally sponsored awards: [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2).  Use of this service eliminates the need for independent documentation of comparison airfares, as the service captures the required documentation automatically.  When completing an expense report, travelers (or their designees) need only attach the following:
In the event a traveler (or their designee) opts to book air travel outside [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2), the traveler (or their designee) is still responsible for documenting their selection of air travel within the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines, consistent with business requirements.  To do so, the traveler (or their designee) is expected to include in the expense report airfare comparisons from a travel service (e.g., [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2), Sanditz, Travelocity, Orbitz, Expedia) contemporaneous with the booking that includes:
**C.** **Air Travel on a Federally Sponsored Award: Other Applicable Rules**
In addition to the specific rules discussed in the sections above, the following rules, organized by subject matter, apply to air travel on federally sponsored awards and subawards:
## 6. Air Travel on Federally Sponsored Awards: Fly America Act
Travelers (or their designees) on University business funded by a federal award must comply with the requirements of [2 CFR Part 200](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title02/2cfr200_main_02.tpl) and are required by [49 U.S.C. 40118](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title49/pdf/USCODE-2011-title49-subtitleVII-partA-subparti-chap401-sec40118.pdf), commonly referred to as the “Fly America Act,” to use United States air carrier service for all air travel and cargo transportation services funded by the United States Government.  Accordingly, it is the responsibility of the traveler (or their designee) and their departmental business office to:
Federal regulations (i.e., the Fly America Act) require that federally funded domestic awardees use U.S. flag air carriers when traveling between the U.S. and an international destination, between domestic destinations, or between international destinations to the maximum extent possible.
Any air transportation to, from, between, or within a country other than the U.S. of persons or property paid for from U.S. federal funds must be performed by or under a code-sharing arrangement with a U.S. flag air carrier if service provided by such carrier is available.  **Tickets or documentation for electronic tickets must identify the U.S. flag air carrier’s designator code and flight number**.
For purposes of this requirement, a U.S. flag air carrier service is considered available even though:
Exceptions to the Fly America Act are permitted when one or more of the following conditions exist at the time travel reservations are made:
**A. Fly America Act Documentation**
Air travel that does not involve an exception to the Fly America Act does not require any incremental documentation.  According to the U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”), exceptions to the Fly America Act must be documented.  The University strongly recommends the use of Yale’s preferred travel service for travel on federally sponsored awards: [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2).  Use of this service eliminates the need for independent documentation of Fly America Act exceptions, as the service captures the required documentation automatically.  When completing an expense report, travelers (or their designees) need only attach the following:
In the event a traveler (or their designee) opts to book air travel outside [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2), the traveler (or their designee) is still responsible for documenting any exceptions to the Fly America Act.  To do so, the traveler (or their designee) must include the following information as attachments to the applicable expense report:
1. A completed and signed [Form 3301 FR.06](/policies-procedures/forms/3301-fr06-documentation-travel-non-us-air-carrier) *Documentation for Travel on a Non-U.S. Air Carrier*;
2. A detailed travel itinerary from a travel agent or online travel service (e.g., [World Travel](https://auth.yale.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://us.api.concursolutions.com/saml2), Sanditz, Travelocity, Orbitz, Expedia); and
3. The search results performed at the time of booking from an online travel service that document all available flights and the existence of the Fly America exception identified on the Fly America exception form, if applicable.
***Note***: For those rare situations when a booking from a travel agent or online travel service with accompanying search results is not possible, please provide a detailed explanation as to why the information for items 2. and 3., above, is not being provided in addition to providing [Form 3301 FR.06](/policies-procedures/forms/3301-fr06-documentation-travel-non-us-air-carrier) *Documentation for Travel on a Non-U.S. Air Carrier.* Consideration will be given to the circumstances described by the traveler (or their designee), but an exception to the documentation requirement is not guaranteed.
Travelers (or their designees) ***must not*** charge airfare without the required supporting documentation to a federally sponsored award, unless a documentation exception has been approved per the above note.  Failure to complete and attach all proper documentation (including an approved exception, if applicable) will result in removal of the applicable charge(s) from sponsored awards.
