| This agreement ("Agreement") covers all aspects of my child's participation in the Program (described on Page 1).

I certify that I am the parent or legal guardian of the child named above.

In exchange for Yale allowing my child to participate in the Program, I release Yale from all legal and financial responsibility for any harm that I, my child, or our property might suffer as a result of my child's participation, even if the harm is caused by Yale's negligence. <br> 5. Indemnification. I agree to indemnify and hold Yale harmless from (that is to say, I agree to pay or reimburse Yale for) any costs, penalties, legal fees, or judgments ("Costs") that Yale has to pay related to my child's participation in the Program, even if the Costs resulted from Yale's negligence. <br> 6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. The laws of the State of Connecticut shall govern and the courts of Connecticut shall interpret this Agreement. <br> 7. Binding Agreement.
