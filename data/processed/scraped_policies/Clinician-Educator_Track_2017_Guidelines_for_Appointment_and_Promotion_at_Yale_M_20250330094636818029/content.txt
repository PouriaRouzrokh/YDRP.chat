# Clinician-Educator Track 2017 Guidelines for Appointment and Promotion at Yale Medical School 
This document provides updated guidelines for academic appointment and promotion for the clinician-educator faculty at Yale Medical School. It recognizes the critical role that these faculty play in the clinical, research and educational missions of the Medical School and Medical Center. It defines criteria for evaluating Clinician-Educator faculty that uphold existing Yale standards for excellence, innovation, and scholarship, while defining a broader range of activities that should be considered in the evaluation process.
The evaluation process takes into consideration each faculty member's unique combination of accomplishments in both the clinical and educational arenas. While some faculty may focus and excel in one arena or the other, most will make important and interwoven contributions in both domains. The updated guidelines emphasize the need for each faculty member to articulate their full portfolio of activities and the impact of their contributions.
Thus, Clinician-Educators seeking academic promotion should present evidence of distinguished accomplishments in the clinical or educational arenas, or both. Clinical excellence should be supported by recognition of a high level of clinical expertise, together with evidence for influence on clinical practice, innovative program development or clinical investigation. Educational excellence should be supported by recognition of a high level of teaching expertise, together with quality contributions in the areas of curriculum development, mentoring, educational leadership or educational scholarship.
For both clinical and educational activities, the following parameters are considered: quality, scholarship and recognition. Quality is defined by superior activities and innovation based on objective measures and peer recognition. Activities must be of a sufficient quantity to make substantial contributions, but quantity alone is not sufficient for advancement. Scholarship is a required metric and is defined broadly as materials that are a) peer reviewed, b) available in the public domain, and c) significantly contribute to the field. Scholarship is not limited simply to peer reviewed original research and may occur in print or another media. It may include the following: publication of original research, reviews, editorials and chapters; clinical guidelines and consensus statements; educational material including syllabi, curricula, web-based training modules and courses; educational methods, policy statements, and assessment tools. Recognition is defined by dissemination and adoption outside of Yale, reputation by independent peer review, and measurable impact in the field.
Promotion to Associate Professor requires a regional and emerging national reputation for excellence in clinical and/or educational activities with supporting scholarship. Promotion to Professor also requires a national and/or international reputation for scholarship that has advanced the field and outstanding accomplishments in clinical and/or educational activities as outlined above.
This document is intended to provide guidelines regarding the criteria for appointment and promotion at Yale Medical School. It provides a framework for the faculty to detail their contributions in the CV Supplement that is required with application for appointment or promotion. It also defines criteria to be used by Departmental and School appointment and promotions committees to provide equitable evaluations of applicants.
