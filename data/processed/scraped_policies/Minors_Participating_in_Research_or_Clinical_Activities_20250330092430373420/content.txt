**I.  Age Restrictions**
1. Persons under 12 years of age are prohibited from entering laboratories.
2. Persons aged 12-15 may not enter a Yale laboratory or participate in educational research or clinical activities, unless the activity is an [approved Children and Youth program](http://programs-minors.yale.edu/policy-health-and-safety),  which may include (i) an organized laboratory tour conducted with permission of the faculty member responsible for the laboratory and the Department Chair or their designee, or (ii) a one-time educational or recruitment demonstration.  The sponsoring faculty member will be responsible for proper supervision and for providing any appropriate personal protective equipment for the visitors. Tours must be supervised at all times while on Yale premises, and tour participants may not participate in any research or clinical activities.
3. Persons who are 16 or 17 years of age may request an opportunity to participate in approved educational research and/or clinical activities under the individual mentorship and supervision of a sponsoring faculty member, as described below1.
**II.   Requirements for Working with Minors Aged 16 or 17 in Research/Clinical Activities**
1. The sponsoring faculty member must submit an application for any minor planning to participate in research or clinical activities on campus or remotely, including an appropriate supervisory plan, via EHS Integrator. Apply here: [EHS Integrator](https://ehsis.yale.edu/EHSIntegrator/Registration)
2. The sponsoring faculty member must follow all relevant safety and compliance requirements, and adhere to the supervisory plan as approved by Environmental Health and Safety (EHS). The sponsoring faculty member must also ensure compliance with university policies.
3. The sponsoring faculty member must act as the minor’s direct supervisor or designate one other faculty or staff member to serve in that role.
4. Both the sponsoring faculty member and the designated supervisor, if any, must undergo background checks before the minor may begin the proposed research or clinical activities.  Information on this requirement can be found at <https://programs-minors.yale.edu/FAQs-Labs> .
5. The sponsoring faculty member and the designated supervisor, if any, must ensure that a Yale faculty or staff member or fully-trained graudate student is physically present at all times when the minor is in Yale research, clinical, or office space. Undergraduates cannot supervise minors. In addition, if the minor is working one-on-one,  with faculty or staff members who have not had background checks, the minor must be in view of a Yale faculty or staff member who has had a background check.  Finally the minor many not be present in Yale research, clinical or office space on weekends or outside the normal Monday-Friday hours of their assigned laboratory.
6. A minor must reside within daily commuting distance of Yale with their parent or legal guardian while participating in research or clinical activities at Yale.
7. Healthcare services at Yale Health or elsewhere are not provided by Yale to minors participating in clinical or research activities.  As such, minors must provide proof of medical coverage in the New Haven area for the period that they will be participating in research/clinical activities at Yale.
8. All proposed research or clinical activities conducted by minors in University locations must adhere to the requirements or restrictions imposed by the provost or provost’s designee, the department or school, Environmental Health and Safety (EHS), and where appropriate other compliance units, including the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP), Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and HIPAA. Sponsoring faculty members may impose additional restrictions that they deem necessary for the safety of the minor and other members of the laboratory or work unit.
9. The sponsoring faculty member must ensure that the minor does not enter the work area prior to completing ALL required training. The minor may not participate in research or clinical activities until the minor student registration is authorized by EHS and the sponsoring faculty member is notified via email by the EHS Integrator.
10. The sponsoring faculty member must obtain an [Assumption of Risk/Parental Consent form](/sites/default/files/files/minor-parental-consent.pdf) for all participants prior to allowing the minor to participate in any Yale affiliated research/clinical activities.  The sponsoring faculty member, program director or designee must ensure that these documents are uploaded into EHS Integrator.
11. The sponsoring faculty member must resolve any outstanding compliance issues, as notified via email by EHS Integrator, before the minor application is further processed.
12. The EHS Integrator will automatically generate a Create or Modify request in Sponsored Indentity once the regsitration is submitted. The sponsoring faculty member’s  department business office must approve the new minor  appointment in Sponsored Identity. Individuals approved for participation will be given a classification type of “Minor Student Research/Clinical” in the Sponsored Identity system (minors participating in research or clinical activities may not be entered into Workday). A Yale net ID will be autmatically generated, and notification sent to the minor and relevant department business office.
13. The purpose of the minor’s participation in research/clinical activities at Yale is to provide the minor with an introduction to an academic field of study and research and/or to offer the minor an educational mentoring opportunity. The research/clinical experience at Yale is solely for the educational benefit of the minor and does not constitute an employment relationship between the minor and Yale.  The minor may not receive any wages or other compensation for any of their educational activities at Yale.  A minor may receive a lump-sum stipend  to enable their participation in the activity.
