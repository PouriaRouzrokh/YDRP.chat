The below outline delineates the timeline for academic appointments, promotions, reappointments. Please note the following:
New [appointments](/faculty/academic-professional-development/academic-affairs/arp-process/appts/ "Content: Appointments") are addressed on a rolling basis, and should have paperwork submitted as expeditiously as possible once offer letters are executed (note that the YSM A&P Committees do not regularly meet over the summer, so paperwork submitted during that timeframe will not be reviewed until the fall). Initial appointments only can be retroactive to initial hire/start date.
The below timeline is for all [reappointments](/faculty/academic-professional-development/academic-affairs/arp-process/reappt/ "Content: Reappointments") and [promotions](/faculty/academic-professional-development/academic-affairs/arp-process/promotions/ "Content: Promotions") of faculty in their primary department.
