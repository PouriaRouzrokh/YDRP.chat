# Timeline for A&P Processes

## Overview

Copy Link

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/ysm/image/upload/yms/prod/4583519e-4e0b-4ac8-92a1-6436cd3cbb6a)

The below outline delineates the timeline for academic appointments, promotions, reappointments. Please note the following:

* Some departments have earlier internal deadlines and/or intermediary steps to facilitate faculty reviews and processing steps.
* All are encouraged to keep upcoming academic process dates in mind and to be proactive whenever possible.
* Specifics of what is needed for each track, rank and position are delineated on the [Faculty Tracks, Ranks, and Positions](/faculty/academic-professional-development/academic-affairs/tracks-ranks/ "Content: Faculty Tracks, Ranks, & Positions") webpages.

New [appointments](/faculty/academic-professional-development/academic-affairs/arp-process/appts/ "Content: Appointments") are addressed on a rolling basis, and should have paperwork submitted as expeditiously as possible once offer letters are executed (note that the YSM A&P Committees do not regularly meet over the summer, so paperwork submitted during that timeframe will not be reviewed until the fall). Initial appointments only can be retroactive to initial hire/start date.

The below timeline is for all [reappointments](/faculty/academic-professional-development/academic-affairs/arp-process/reappt/ "Content: Reappointments") and [promotions](/faculty/academic-professional-development/academic-affairs/arp-process/promotions/ "Content: Promotions") of faculty in their primary department.
